# Merge different repos that have no related history

[main.md](https://github.com/pablisch/merge-repositories/blob/main/main.md) is the main instructions for doing this and I recommend going straight there.

There is a [blog post](https://medium.com/p/68280a7bcee5/edit) associated with this repo which you may view if you wish.

[merge-using-github-remotes.md](https://github.com/pablisch/merge-repositories/blob/main/merge-using-github-remotes.md) has a tiny difference from [main.md](https://github.com/pablisch/merge-repositories/blob/main/main.md) to be used if you wish to use GitHub remotes rather than local ones.
To clarify, if you have your repositories on your local machine and you are able to specify their filepaths, then [main.md](https://github.com/pablisch/merge-repositories/blob/main/main.md) will work fine. If you prefer to work with the GitHub remote repositories or simply find it easier to find their cloning addresses than local filepaths then feel free to use [these instructions](https://github.com/pablisch/merge-repositories/blob/main/merge-using-github-remotes.md) instead.

I recommend inspecting folders and files using Finder (or equivalent) or VSCode but if you prefer to do this in terminal (other flavours available) then you may follow [these instructions](https://github.com/pablisch/merge-repositories/blob/main/local-repos-with-checkout.md) to checkout onto a new branchof the remote and merge that instead. Please note that these were the oiginal instructions that I came across but I have not tested them myself.
